          <h3>Raiders of the Lost Ark</h3>
          <p>
            Lucas conceived Raiders of the Lost Ark in the early 1970s. Seeking
            to modernize the serial films of the early 20th-century, he
            developed the idea further with Kaufman, who suggested the Ark as
            the film's goal. Lucas eventually focused on developing his 1977
            space opera Star Wars.

          <h3>Temple of Doom</h3>
          <p>
            The film was released to financial success but initial reviews were
            mixed, criticizing its darker elements and violence. However,
            critical opinion has improved since 1984, citing the film's
            intensity and imagination.

          <h3>The Last Crusade</h3>
          <p>
            After the mixed reaction to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,
            Spielberg chose to tone down the dark tone and graphic violence in
            the next installment. During the five years between The Temple of
            Doom and the Last Crusade, he and executive producer Lucas revieved
            several scripts before accepting Jeffrey Boam's.
